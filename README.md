### Game Mechanics
- Players will click various story paths to get different endings.
- Some decisions can lead to death.
- Some decisions can loop a character back to an earlier part in the story.
- If the player can make it through the weekend and get to work on Monday, they "win". 

### Characters
- The side characters in the game range from desparate exes, drunk friends, a biploar UberEats driver, a kid in need, and so on. How the player interacts with each can make a difference in how the story goes.

### Environments
- Environment 1 - At home, rainy day, cozy
- Environment 2 - Supermarket, stay home option
- Environment 3 - Beach, road trip option

### The Story
You wake up late on a Saturday afternoon. It's up to the player on how they're going to spend their weekend (and if they're even going to make it through it!). 

### Unique Selling Points
1. Funny, relatable scenarios.
2. Easy to play, multiple endings to find.
